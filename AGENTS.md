# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
go build .

# Run
go run . [flags] grammar.y

# Test (no test suite exists; validate by generating a grammar)
go vet ./...
```

There is no Makefile; standard Go tooling is used throughout.

## Architecture

This tool (`package main`) reads a YACC grammar (`.y` file) and writes a Go parser. The main logic lives in `goyacc.go` (~3700 lines); union layout inference is in `unionsize.go` (uses `go/packages` to inspect the target package's types at generation time).

The upstream source is [`cmd/goyacc`](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/tools/+/master:cmd/goyacc/) in the Go `x/tools` repository ([GitHub mirror](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/cmd/goyacc/)). This fork adds the enhancements described below.

### Processing pipeline

1. **Lexing** — `gettok()` / `getword()` tokenize the `.y` input
2. **Grammar parsing** — `setup()` reads productions, types, and directives into global arrays
3. **State generation** — `stagen()` builds the LALR(1) automaton (states, items, lookahead sets)
4. **Table output** — `output()` / `go2out()` write the action/goto tables to the output file
5. **Code emission** — `cppcode()`, `cpyact()`, and related functions copy user code sections verbatim into the output

### Key data structures

- `Pitem` / `Item` — a production rule with a dot position and lookahead set
- `Symb` — a grammar symbol (terminal or nonterminal)
- `Lkset` — a bitset representing lookahead tokens
- `Row` — one row of the action table (actions + default)
- `Error` — a custom error message keyed by (state, token)

### Enhancements over standard goyacc

**Discriminated `unsafe.Pointer` union** (`%union`): `yySymType` holds a `data [N]uintptr` array (sized to the largest member) plus a `ptrs [M]unsafe.Pointer` GC-keepalive array. All member types are stored/read via `uintptr` casts, eliminating interface boxing. Array sizes and pointer-word offsets (for the GC-keepalive array) are inferred automatically at generation time via `go/packages` (`inferUnionLayout` in `unionsize.go`). Typed getter (`<member>()`) and setter (`set<member>()`) methods are generated for each member.

**Custom error messages**: `// error: "message"` comments in grammar rules are collected into a lookup table keyed by (state, token) pair and emitted into the generated parser.

### Generated output

The emitted file is valid but unformatted Go. Callers should post-process with `goimports` and/or `gofumpt`.

Generated parsers expose:
- `yySymType` — the semantic value type on the parser stack
- `yyLexer` interface — `Lex(lval *yySymType) int`
- `yyParser` interface — `Parse(yylex yyLexer) int`
- `yyParse(yylex yyLexer) int` — convenience entry point
